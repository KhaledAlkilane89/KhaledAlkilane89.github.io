abstract = {From finance and healthcare to transportation and beyond, effective time series modeling underpins a wide range of applications. While transformers have achieved success, their reliance on global context limits scalability for lengthy sequences due to the quadratic increase in computational cost with sequence length. Recent research suggests linear models can achieve comparable performance with lower complexity. However, the heterogeneity and non-stationary characteristics of time series data continue to challenge single models’ ability to capture complex temporal dynamics, especially in long-term forecasting. This paper proposes MixMamba, a novel framework for time series modeling applicable across diverse domains. The framework leverages the content-based reasoning strengths of the Mamba model by integrating it as an expert within a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. This framework decomposes modeling into a pool of specialized experts, enabling the model to learn robust representations and capture the full spectrum of patterns present in time series data. Furthermore, a dynamic gating network is introduced within the framework. This network adaptively allocates each data segment to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. This is crucial in non-stationary time series, as it allows the model to adjust dynamically to temporal changes in the underlying data distribution. To prevent bias towards a limited subset of experts, a load balancing loss function is incorporated. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method in various time series modeling tasks, including long-term and short-term forecasting, as well as classification.}

abstract = {Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and various smart applications. To achieve this, effectively capturing the complex interplay between spatial and temporal dependencies across traffic nodes is essential. However, existing research often focuses solely on fixed spatial dependencies between neighboring nodes, neglecting the potential influence of distant nodes. This paper addresses these limitations by exploring two key types of relationships among traffic nodes. First, we examine indirect relationships based on similarity, where nodes exhibit similar traffic patterns irrespective of their physical proximity. Second, we investigate direct causal relationships, where traffic conditions at one node are directly influenced by other nodes. Based on these findings, we propose a novel approach named TPSC (Traffic Prediction using nodes Similarity and Causal relations). TPSC incorporates a classifier that utilizes the K-Prototype algorithm to group nodes based on their traffic similarity and nearby points of interest (POIs). Separate models are then trained for each cluster. Our model leverages a spatial module that employs graph convolutional network representation learning alongside transfer entropy to capture causal relationships and dynamic spatial dependencies. Additionally, a temporal module is introduced to capture periodic temporal dependencies across three components: recent patterns, daily patterns, and weekly patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate proposed model on four large-scale traffic datasets for multiple traffic characteristics including speed, flow, and travel time. The experimental results demonstrate that TPSC surpasses the performance of the compared baselines, highlighting its superior predictive capabilities in traffic prediction.}

abstract = {Travel time estimation (TTE) is a crucial and challenging task due to the complex spatial and dynamic temporal correlations between local and global traffic regions. Though many existing methods have used multi-graph structures to model traffic variations, the majority of them are unable to capture such sophisticated local and global perspectives dynamically at different time-intervals. Furthermore, these methods have used shallow graphs (i.e., based on speed or distance between traffic nodes), thereby limiting their ability to learn the latent dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Hybrid Local-Global Spatio-Temporal (HLGST) framework for TTE. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic composition unit that builds local traffic information and multi-dynamic semantic graphs based on the similarities between nodes. Then, the HLGST model learns the local and global dependencies via hybrid correlation method. It mainly comprises two modules: (1) local correlation module that integrates casual TCN layers with a self-attention mechanism to capture local dependencies of traffic patterns; (2) triplet-siamese GCN (TS-GCN) module that is employed to smoothly capture global dependencies based on triplet relationships between multi-dynamical semantic graphs. Moreover, we build a dynamic adaptive learning algorithm to transfer the gained knowledge and leverage it to model multi-objective prediction tasks collaboratively. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world traffic datasets (Xi’an and Chengdu) demonstrate that our HLGST model outperforms compared baselines and achieves significant improvement.}

  abstract={Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, due to the high variation and complexity of road networks, the majority of prior methods are inefficient to extracting both spatial and temporal dynamic correlations. Additionally, most of them often use simplistic graph representations to depict the traffic nodes’ interconnections and separate temporal modules to capture time variations. Thus, taking into account the semantic relationships among traffic variables is a difficult task that plays a crucial role in gaining a comprehensive understanding of traffic networks’ topology. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new deep learning framework called Triplet-Contrastive Periodical Siamese Graph networks (TCPSG). This framework incorporates a novel combination of Siamese graph networks and triplet contrastive learning, as well as considering periodicity patterns in traffic. Specifically, we construct semantical and periodical graph adjacency matrices that represent latent spatial correlations between nodes and periodicity dependencies of recent, daily, and weekly time-periods. Then, we devise a contrastivebased learning method that combines a triplet siamese graph structure with a dual-gated Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) based module to simultaneously learn traffic patterns’ similarities among those three periodic components and longterm dynamic temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TCPSG consistently outperforms baselines in all prediction horizons.}

abstract = {Traffic forecasting constitutes a task of great importance in intelligent transport systems. Owing to the non-Euclidean structure of traffic data, the complicated spatial correlations, and the dynamic temporal dependencies, it is challenging to predict traffic accurately. Despite the fact that few prior studies have considered the interconnections between multiple traffic nodes at the same timestep, the majority of studies fail to capture the dependencies among multiple nodes at different timesteps. Furthermore, most existing work generates shallow graphs based solely on the distance between traffic nodes, which limits their representation competence and declines their power in capturing complex correlations. In particular, inspired by the recent breakthroughs in the generative adversarial network (GAN) and the power of the graph convolution network (GCN) in handling non-Euclidean data, this paper puts forward an adversarial multi-graph convolutional neural network model, named TFGAN, to address the abovementioned problems. We integrate the unsupervised model elasticity with the supervision provided by supervised training to help the GAN generator model generates accurate traffic predictions. To improve the representation and model the implicit correlations effectively, multiple GCNs are constructed within the generator based on various perspectives, such as similarity, correlation, and spatial distance. Meanwhile, GRU and self-attention are applied after each graph to capture the dynamic temporal dependencies across nodes. The comprehensive experiments on three different traffic variables (traffic flow, speed, and travel time) using six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TFGAN outperforms the related state-of-the-art models and achieves significant results.}

abstract = {Accurate travel time prediction is one of the most promising intelligent transportation system (ITS) services, which can greatly support route planning, ride-sharing, navigation applications, and effective traffic management. Several factors, like spatial, temporal, and external, have big effects on traffic patterns, and therefore, it is important to develop a mechanism that can jointly capture correlations of these components. However, spatial sparsity issues make travel time prediction very challenging, especially when dealing with the origin-destination (OD) method, since the trajectory data may not be available. In this paper, we introduce a unified deep learning-based framework named joint spatial-temporal correlation (JSTC) mechanism to improve the accuracy of OD travel time prediction. First, we design a spatiotemporal correlation block that combines two modules: self-convolutional attention integrated with a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to capture the spatial correlations along with the temporal dependencies. Then, we enhance our model performance through adopting a multi-head attention module to learn the attentional weights of the spatial, temporal, and external features based on their contributions to the output and speed up the training process. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real-world traffic datasets (NYC, Chengdu, and Xi’an) show the efficiency of our model and its superiority compared to other methods.},
