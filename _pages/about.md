üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Zhejiang University-University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (ZJU-UIUC), working with Professor Der-Horng Lee on deep learning and intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

üî¨ I specialize in ML/DL for traffic and time series analysis, with a current focus on RL and generative AI.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from DUT, China, where I focused on traffic prediction in urban road networks using deep learning under the supervision of Professor Shen Yanming. Prior to that, I obtained a Master‚Äôs degree with a major in Electronic Information & Communication Engineering from HUST, China. My research focuses on the intersection of time series analysis and spatio-temporal data mining, with a particular emphasis on developing and applying advanced DL techniques into ITS.

Research Interests
I am particularly interested in exploring the potential of reinforcement learning and generative AI for addressing complex challenges in time series and traffic domains. My current areas of investigation include:

Time Series Analysis: Foundation models, generation, forecasting and classification techniques.
Spatio-Temporal Data Mining: Representation learning and AI applications in ITS.
Multimodal Learning and Alignment: Time series LLMs and Generative models.
